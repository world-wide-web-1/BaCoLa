###### ```print = "Hello, BaCoLa!".```
##### BaCoLa is short for **Ba**sic **Co**ding **La**nguage.

BaCoLa is just something I like to work on in my spare time.\
The basic example uses imports:
```print = "Example Script executing!"
import "%MFOLDER%/exampleModule.bclm"
example = "Executed!"
unload Example
```
That script is equivalent to (also in BaCoLa)
```print = "Hello, World!".```\
If you may have noticed, there are periods at the end of **some** lines.
