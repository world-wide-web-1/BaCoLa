###### ```print = "Hello, BaCoLa!".```
##### BaCoLa (Buh-Kol-Uh) is short for **Ba**sic **Co**ding **La**nguage.
### Note: This programming language doesn't work on Windows for some reason, I am trying to fix it.

BaCoLa is just something I like to work on in my spare time.\
The basic example uses imports:
```
print = "Example Script executing!"
import "%MFOLDER%/exampleModule.bclm"
example = "Executed!"
unload Example
```
That script is equivalent to (also in BaCoLa)
```print = "Hello, World!".```\
If you may have noticed, there are periods at the end of **some** lines.

This programming language has lots more work to do on it.
